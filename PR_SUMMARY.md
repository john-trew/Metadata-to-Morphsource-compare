# PR Summary: Fix Workflow Skip Issue for Query Submissions

## 🐛 Issue
Issue #13 "Tell me about lizard specimens" was created but the `issue-query-trigger` workflow was skipped, preventing the query from being processed.

## 🔍 Investigation
When investigating the skipped workflow, I found:
- ✅ Workflow was triggered by Issue #13 creation
- ❌ Workflow conclusion: `skipped`
- ❌ Issue #13 has **no labels**
- ⚠️ Workflow required `query-request` label to run

## 🎯 Root Cause
The workflow had a job-level condition:
```yaml
if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'query-request')
```

This condition failed because Issue #13 had no labels. Why? GitHub's issue creation URL with `?labels=query-request` parameter only **pre-fills** the label in the UI. Users must explicitly confirm or the issue is created without labels.

## ✅ Solution
Changed the workflow to detect query submissions by **content** instead of **labels**:

### Detection Methods
1. **Body Marker**: Check if issue body contains "MorphoSource Query Submission"
2. **Title Pattern**: Check if issue title starts with "Query:"
3. **Auto-Label**: Automatically add `query-request` label when detected

### Workflow Changes
**Before:**
```yaml
jobs:
  trigger-query:
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'query-request')  # Hard requirement
    steps: [...]
```

**After:**
```yaml
jobs:
  trigger-query:
    steps:
      - name: Check if issue is a query submission
        # Detect by body marker OR title pattern
      
      - name: Extract query
        if: steps.check.outputs.is_query == 'true'
      
      - name: Add query-request label
        if: steps.check.outputs.is_query == 'true'
        # Auto-add label for organization
      
      - name: Process query
        if: steps.check.outputs.is_query == 'true'
```
