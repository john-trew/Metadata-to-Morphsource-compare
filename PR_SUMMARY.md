# Pull Request Summary: ChatGPT Query Formatting Integration

## Overview

This PR implements intelligent query formatting for the MorphoSource Query System. Natural language queries are now automatically optimized by ChatGPT before being sent to the MorphoSource API, significantly improving search accuracy and results quality.

## Problem Solved

Previously, raw user queries were sent directly to the MorphoSource API without any preprocessing:
- User: "Tell me about lizard specimens"
- API received: "Tell me about lizard specimens" (including conversational words)
- Result: Less accurate searches, potentially missing relevant specimens

## Solution Implemented

Added a new ChatGPT Query Formatter job that preprocesses queries before API calls:

```
User Query → [ChatGPT Formatter] → [MorphoSource API] → [ChatGPT Processor] → Results
```

### Key Changes

1. **New Job**: `query-formatter`
   - Uses GPT-4 to analyze and optimize queries
   - Extracts scientific terms, removes conversational words
   - Outputs formatted query and API parameters

2. **Modified Job**: `morphosource-api`
   - Now uses formatted queries from Job 1
   - More accurate, targeted searches

3. **Enhanced Job**: `chatgpt-processing`
   - Includes formatting context in analysis
   - More transparent results for users

## Files Changed

### Workflow Changes
- ✏️ `.github/workflows/query-processor.yml` - Added query-formatter job, updated dependencies

### Documentation Updates
- ✏️ `README.md` - Updated architecture description
- ✏️ `docs/QUERY_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Added Job 1 documentation
- ✏️ `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated architecture diagram
- ➕ `CHATGPT_QUERY_FORMATTER_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide
- ➕ `BEFORE_AND_AFTER_FLOW.md` - Visual comparison of old vs new flow

### Tests Added
- ➕ `tests/test_workflow_structure.py` - 6 new tests validating workflow structure

## Test Results

All tests pass (42/42):
```
✅ 36 existing tests (compare, verify, run_comparison)
✅ 6 new workflow structure tests
```

## Query Transformation Examples

| User Input | Formatted Query |
|------------|-----------------|
| "Tell me about lizard specimens" | `lizard` |
| "How many snake specimens are available?" | `snake` |
| "Show me CT scans of crocodiles" | `crocodile CT` |
| "What Anolis specimens are in the database?" | `Anolis` |
| "Find specimens with micro-CT data" | `micro-CT` |

## Benefits

1. **Better Search Accuracy** - Scientific terms properly extracted, noise removed
2. **Improved User Experience** - Natural language queries work better
3. **Full Transparency** - Users see how queries are formatted
4. **No Breaking Changes** - Existing functionality preserved
5. **Fallback Mechanism** - Works even if formatting fails

## Technical Details

### Job Dependencies
```
query-formatter (no deps)
    ↓
morphosource-api (needs: query-formatter)
    ↓
chatgpt-processing (needs: [query-formatter, morphosource-api])
```

### Artifacts Generated
- `formatted-query` - Query formatting details (JSON)
- `morphosource-results` - API search results (JSON)
- `chatgpt-response` - Final response (JSON)

### Performance Impact
- **Query formatting**: ~5-10 seconds (GPT-4 API call)
- **Total processing time**: Still ~1-2 minutes (no significant change)
- **API usage**: +1 ChatGPT call per query

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be configured in GitHub Secrets (already required)
- ✅ `MORPHOSOURCE_API_KEY` optional (already supported)

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Manual workflow trigger still works
- ✅ Existing issues/workflows not affected

### Migration
- ✅ Zero configuration needed - merge and it works
- ✅ No user action required

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ YAML syntax validation
2. ✅ Job dependency verification
3. ✅ Artifact upload/download checks
4. ✅ Output parameter validation
5. ✅ Integration test simulation (5 query types)
6. ✅ All existing tests still pass

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation added:
- `CHATGPT_QUERY_FORMATTER_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details
- `BEFORE_AND_AFTER_FLOW.md` - Visual before/after comparison
- Updated existing guides with new architecture

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: LOW

**Reasons**:
- Uses existing infrastructure (ChatGPT already in use)
- Fallback mechanism if formatting fails
- All tests pass
- No breaking changes
- Can be reverted cleanly if needed

## Review Checklist

- [x] Code follows repository standards
- [x] All tests pass (42/42)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] YAML syntax validated
- [x] Job dependencies correct
- [x] Artifacts properly configured
- [x] No secrets exposed
- [x] Backward compatible
- [x] Performance acceptable

## Next Steps

After merge:
1. Monitor first few query runs
2. Collect user feedback on query formatting
3. Consider optimizations based on usage patterns

## Related Issues

Implements functionality requested in: "Right now it sends the raw request to morphosource. It should first send it to ChatGPT and then ChatGPT adjusts the format of the query into an API call to morphosource to find species names related to lizards for example."

# PR Summary: Fix Workflow Skip Issue for Query Submissions

## 🐛 Issue
Issue #13 "Tell me about lizard specimens" was created but the `issue-query-trigger` workflow was skipped, preventing the query from being processed.

## 🔍 Investigation
When investigating the skipped workflow, I found:
- ✅ Workflow was triggered by Issue #13 creation
- ❌ Workflow conclusion: `skipped`
- ❌ Issue #13 has **no labels**
- ⚠️ Workflow required `query-request` label to run

## 🎯 Root Cause
The workflow had a job-level condition:
```yaml
if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'query-request')
```

This condition failed because Issue #13 had no labels. Why? GitHub's issue creation URL with `?labels=query-request` parameter only **pre-fills** the label in the UI. Users must explicitly confirm or the issue is created without labels.

## ✅ Solution
Changed the workflow to detect query submissions by **content** instead of **labels**:

### Detection Methods
1. **Body Marker**: Check if issue body contains "MorphoSource Query Submission"
2. **Title Pattern**: Check if issue title starts with "Query:"
3. **Auto-Label**: Automatically add `query-request` label when detected

### Workflow Changes
**Before:**
```yaml
jobs:
  trigger-query:
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'query-request')  # Hard requirement
    steps: [...]
```

**After:**
```yaml
jobs:
  trigger-query:
    steps:
      - name: Check if issue is a query submission
        # Detect by body marker OR title pattern
      
      - name: Extract query
        if: steps.check.outputs.is_query == 'true'
      
      - name: Add query-request label
        if: steps.check.outputs.is_query == 'true'
        # Auto-add label for organization
      
      - name: Process query
        if: steps.check.outputs.is_query == 'true'
```
