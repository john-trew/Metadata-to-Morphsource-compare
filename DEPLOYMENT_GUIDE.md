# Deployment Guide for Repository Owner

## Quick Start: Enable GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to deploy the MorphoSource AI Assistant:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

That's it! The site will automatically deploy.

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

- The deployment workflow will run automatically
- Check the **Actions** tab to see progress
- Deployment typically takes 1-2 minutes
- Look for the "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow

### Step 3: Access Your Site

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
```
https://johntrue15.github.io/Metadata-to-Morphsource-compare/
```

## Configuration (Optional)

### Add Repository Secrets

While the current implementation works client-side (users provide their own API keys), you can optionally add secrets for future backend implementations:

1. Go to: **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Add these secrets:

**OPENAI_API_KEY** (Optional)
- For future backend implementations
- Current version doesn't need this
- Users provide their own keys

**MORPHOSOURCE_API_KEY** (Already configured)
- Used by the comparison workflow
- Keep this for the existing functionality

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:

### 1. Site Loads
- [ ] Visit https://johntrue15.github.io/Metadata-to-Morphsource-compare/
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Interface displays correctly

### 2. Basic Functionality
- [ ] API key prompt appears
- [ ] Can enter test API key
- [ ] Example prompts are visible
- [ ] Interface is responsive

### 3. Check Deployment Status
```bash
# Via GitHub CLI (if installed)
gh workflow view "Deploy GitHub Pages"

# Or check via web
# Go to: https://github.com/johntrue15/Metadata-to-Morphsource-compare/actions
```

## Testing the Deployed Site

### With Your Own OpenAI API Key

1. Get an API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Visit your deployed site
3. Enter the API key when prompted
4. Try the example query: "Tell me about lizards on MorphoSource"
5. Verify:
   - Thinking indicator appears
   - Tool call is displayed
   - Response is generated

## Troubleshooting Deployment

### Issue: Workflow Doesn't Run

**Check:**
1. GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
2. Source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`

**Solution:**
- Manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab
- Check workflow permissions in Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General

### Issue: 404 Error

**Possible causes:**
1. Deployment hasn't completed yet (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. GitHub Pages not enabled
3. Wrong URL

**Solution:**
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- Verify Pages settings
- Use correct URL format

### Issue: Blank Page

**Possible causes:**
1. JavaScript errors
2. Browser compatibility
3. Cached old version

**Solution:**
- Check browser console (F12)
- Try different browser
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## Updating the Site

Any changes pushed to the `main` branch in the `docs/` folder will automatically trigger redeployment:

```bash
# Make changes to docs/index.html or other files
git add docs/
git commit -m "Update website"
git push origin main
```

The site will redeploy automatically within 2-3 minutes.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. Add a CNAME file in the `docs/` folder:
   ```bash
   echo "your-domain.com" > docs/CNAME
   ```

2. Configure your DNS:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to: `johntrue15.github.io`
   - Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)

3. GitHub Pages will automatically configure HTTPS

## Monitoring

### Check Deployment Logs

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on latest "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow
3. View logs for any errors

### Check Site Analytics (Optional)

GitHub Pages doesn't provide analytics by default, but you can add:
- Google Analytics
- Plausible Analytics
- Simple Analytics

Add the tracking code to `docs/index.html` in the `<head>` section.

## Rollback

If you need to rollback to a previous version:

```bash
# Find the commit you want to revert to
git log --oneline

# Revert to that commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Push changes
git push origin main
```

The site will automatically redeploy with the old version.

## Cost

**GitHub Pages:**
- âœ… Free for public repositories
- âœ… 100GB bandwidth per month
- âœ… Unlimited builds

**OpenAI API:**
- Users pay for their own usage
- No cost to repository owner
- Typical cost: $0.01-0.05 per query

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Review [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
2. Check deployment logs in Actions tab
3. Review browser console for errors
4. Check the [Query System Guide](docs/QUERY_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md) for usage instructions

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. âœ… Test the site thoroughly
2. âœ… Share the URL with users
3. âœ… Update documentation if needed
4. âœ… Monitor for any issues
5. âœ… Consider adding analytics (optional)
6. âœ… Set up custom domain (optional)

## Maintenance

**Regular tasks:**
- Check for security updates
- Monitor user feedback
- Update documentation as needed
