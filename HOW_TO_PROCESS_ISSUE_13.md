# How to Process Issue #13 Now

## Current Status
Issue #13 ("Query: Tell me about lizard specimens") exists but has not been processed because the workflow was skipped due to missing the `query-request` label.

## The Fix is Ready
The workflow has been fixed and will now automatically detect query submissions even without the label. However, Issue #13 was created before this fix, so it needs a manual trigger.

## Option 1: Add the Label (Recommended)
This is the simplest way to process Issue #13:

1. Go to Issue #13: https://github.com/johntrue15/Metadata-to-Morphsource-compare/issues/13
2. Click on the "Labels" section in the right sidebar
3. Select or type `query-request` 
4. The workflow will automatically trigger on the `labeled` event
5. Results will be posted as a comment within 1-2 minutes

## Option 2: Manually Trigger the Workflow
If adding a label doesn't work, you can manually trigger the query processor:

1. Go to Actions: https://github.com/johntrue15/Metadata-to-Morphsource-compare/actions/workflows/query-processor.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter the query: `Tell me about lizard specimens`
4. Enter the issue number: `13`
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Results will be posted to Issue #13

## Option 3: Close and Recreate
Create a new issue with the same query:

1. Use the web form: https://johntrue15.github.io/Metadata-to-Morphsource-compare/
2. Enter: "Tell me about lizard specimens"
3. Click "Prepare to Submit Query"
4. Create the GitHub issue
5. **With the fix in place**, the workflow will now work even if the label isn't applied
6. Close Issue #13 as a duplicate

## Verification
After processing, you should see:
- âœ… A comment saying "ðŸ”„ Query received!"
- âœ… The `query-request` label added (if using Option 1)
- âœ… A comment saying "âœ… Query processor started!"
- âœ… The `processing` label added
- âœ… Results posted as a comment (after 1-2 minutes)
- âœ… Issue automatically closed with `completed` label

## Future Issues
All future query submissions will work automatically thanks to this fix, even if users forget to apply the label. The workflow now:
- Detects queries by checking the issue body or title
- Automatically adds the label
- Processes the query without manual intervention

## Questions?
If you encounter any issues, please:
1. Check the workflow run logs in the Actions tab
2. Look for error messages in issue comments
3. Create a new issue (without the `query-request` label) describing the problem
