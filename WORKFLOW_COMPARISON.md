# Workflow Behavior: Before vs After Fix

## The Problem with Issue #13

**Issue #13 Details:**
- Title: "Query: Tell me about lizard specimens"
- Body: Contains "MorphoSource Query Submission" marker
- Labels: **NONE** (this is the problem!)
- Result: Workflow triggered but was **skipped**

## Before Fix ❌

```yaml
jobs:
  trigger-query:
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'query-request')  # ← REQUIRED LABEL
    steps:
      # ... process query
```

**Flow:**
```
Issue #13 Created (no labels)
    ↓
Workflow Triggered
    ↓
Check: Does issue have 'query-request' label?
    ↓
NO → ❌ SKIP JOB
    ↓
No processing, no results
```

**Why it failed:**
- GitHub's issue creation URL with `?labels=query-request` only **pre-fills** the label
- User must click to confirm labels in the GitHub UI
- If not confirmed, issue is created without labels
- Workflow condition fails → job skips

## After Fix ✅

```yaml
jobs:
  trigger-query:
    # No label requirement - runs for all issues
    steps:
      - name: Check if issue is a query submission
        # Checks body content or title format
        
      - name: Extract query
        if: is_query == 'true'  # ← Only if detected as query
        
      - name: Add label automatically
        if: is_query == 'true'
        
      - name: Process query
        if: is_query == 'true'
```

**Flow:**
```
Issue #13 Created (no labels)
    ↓
Workflow Triggered
    ↓
Check: Does body contain "MorphoSource Query Submission"?
    ↓
YES → ✅ CONTINUE
    ↓
Auto-add 'query-request' label
    ↓
Extract query: "Tell me about lizard specimens"
    ↓
Post "Processing..." comment
    ↓
Trigger query-processor.yml
    ↓
Results posted!
```

## Detection Logic

The workflow now detects query submissions using TWO methods:

### Method 1: Body Marker (Primary)
```bash
if echo "$ISSUE_BODY" | grep -q "MorphoSource Query Submission"; then
  is_query=true
fi
```
- Checks if issue body contains the marker text
- This is added automatically by the web form
- **Issue #13 has this ✓**

### Method 2: Title Prefix (Fallback)
```bash
elif echo "$ISSUE_TITLE" | grep -q "^Query:"; then
  is_query=true
fi
```
- Checks if title starts with "Query:"
- Works even if user manually creates issue
- **Issue #13 has this too ✓**

### Method 3: Neither (Skip)
```bash
else
  is_query=false
  # Regular bug reports, feature requests, etc.
fi
```

## Test Cases

| Issue Type | Body Marker | Title Prefix | Detected? | Label Added? |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Issue #13 (from form) | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| Manual query with title | ✗ | ✓ | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| Manual query with marker | ✓ | ✗ | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| Bug report | ✗ | ✗ | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |
| Feature request | ✗ | ✗ | ❌ NO | ❌ NO |

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **🔧 Fixes Issue #13** - Will now process correctly
2. **🛡️ Robust** - Works even if labels aren't applied
3. **↔️ Backward Compatible** - Still works with existing labeled issues
4. **🎯 Accurate** - Doesn't process non-query issues
5. **🏷️ Auto-Labels** - Adds label for organization
6. **👥 User-Friendly** - No extra steps for users

## How to Verify the Fix

### For Issue #13 Specifically:
1. Manually add the `query-request` label to Issue #13
2. The workflow will trigger on the `labeled` event
3. It will detect the query and process it

### For Future Issues:
1. Create a new issue using the web form
2. Even if the label isn't applied, it will work
3. Watch for automatic label addition
4. See query processing start automatically

## Implementation Details

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/issue-query-trigger.yml` - Core fix
- `docs/QUERY_SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md` - Updated troubleshooting
- `WORKFLOW_SKIP_FIX.md` - Technical documentation
- `WORKFLOW_COMPARISON.md` - This file

**Lines of Code:**
- Added: ~40 lines (detection logic, labeling step)
- Removed: ~2 lines (old label requirement)
- Modified: ~5 lines (added conditionals to existing steps)

**Testing:**
- Bash script validation ✓
- YAML syntax validation ✓
- Logic flow verification ✓
- Multiple test case scenarios ✓
